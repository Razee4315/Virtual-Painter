# Virtual Painter 🎨

A Python application that uses OpenCV and Mediapipe for real-time hand tracking to create a virtual painting experience. Draw in the air using just your hands!

## Features ✨

- **Real-time Hand Tracking**: Precise finger detection and gesture recognition
- **Multiple Drawing Tools**:
  - Freehand drawing with smooth lines
  - Rectangle tool
  - Circle tool
  - Eraser tool
- **Color Selection**: Choose from various colors in the toolbar
- **Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-use toolbar with visual feedback
- **Gesture Controls**: Natural hand movements for drawing and tool selection

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- Python 3.10.12
- OpenCV (cv2) for image processing and webcam interaction
- Mediapipe for hand tracking
- NumPy for array manipulation

## Installation 📥

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
